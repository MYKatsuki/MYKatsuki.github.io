## Introduction

For my final project for Biostatistics 431 I chose to analyze publicly available data from the NHANES database (2017-2020). I chose to focus on analyses exploring the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) for adult (age 18-79) females in the cohort and other variables available in the data set. 

## Methods & Results

I completed five analyses as a part of this project. 

Analysis A - Differences in BMI and waist circumference for adult males and female in the cohort.
